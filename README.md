# DevCup 2016


My submission this year is a premium laundry service mobile app called **LaundryBoy**.


The theme of this DevCup is *Automate*


While thinking of a submission that fits the theme, I realized that I forgot to do a household chore back at my place: get laundry.


I realized how much it is of a hassle for me to text my laundromat and ask, *"Is my laundry ready for delivery? How much? Can you please bring a change for XXX pesos?"*

And I have to do that *every freaking week* and I have been doing so for *3 freaking years*

I thought, it would be nice to have a mobile app that would help me manage my laundry, and automatically notify me if my laundry is ready for pick up. And bill me via credit card so that I don't have to ask my laundromat everytime to bring some change.

So that's the story behind my idea.
